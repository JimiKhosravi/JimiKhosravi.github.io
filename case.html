    <h1>Case Study for <span class="myflix-style">myFlix</span> full-stack project</h1>
    <div class="intro">
      <div class="intro-content">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><span class="myflix-style">myFlix</span> is a web app, developed using the MERN stack, that provides users
          with access to information about movies, directors, and genres. Users are able to create an account, update
          their personal data, and create a list of favorite movies.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>Purpose & Context</h2>
        <p><span class="myflix-style">myFlix</span> was a personal project I built to demonstrate my mastery of
          full-stack JavaScript development.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>The aim of the project was to have an ambitious full-stack project I can add to my professional portfolio.
          The problem I wanted to solve is to build the complete server-side and client-side for the application from
          scratch.</p>

    <div class="server-side">
      <div class="server-content">
        <h3>Server-Side</h3>
        <p>I created a RESTful API using Node.js and Express, that interacts with a non-relational database (MongoDB).
          The API can be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET or POST. To retrieve data from and store data
          in the database, CRUD methods are used. The API provides movie information in JSON format.</p>
        <br />
        <p>

              class="material-icons arrow-right"> arrow_right </span><span>View endpoints</span></a>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>To test the API, I used Postman. I also included user authentication and authorization code in the form of
          basic HTTP authentication and JWT authentication.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="client-side">
      <div class="client-content">
        <h3>Client-Side</h3>
        <p>After completing the API, I started to build the interface users would need when making requests to, and
          receiving responses from, the server-side. It is a single-page, responsive application, developed with React.
          It provides several interface views, including, but not limited to, a main view (shows a list
          of all movies), single movie view (shows data about a single movie and allows users to add the movie to their
          list of favorites), a login view, a registration view and a profile view (where users can update their user
          data and list of favorites).</p>

    </div>
    <div class="challenges">
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>I enjoyed building the database and setting up the backend. My analytical mind liked to see the order and
        structure of it, and I was able to fly through that build. This was both my favorite and most challenging
        project. I also quickly became familiar with using the terminal. Developing the client-side, it took me a while
        to understand how React work and how to achieve the desired results.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="duration">
      <h2>Duration</h2>
      <p>The development of the client-side took me twice. It was because I needed time to wrap my head around how
        Node.js, Express and React work.</p>
